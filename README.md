## Download ROMEO
Ordered from simple to more involved approaches.
### Option 1: [Download Executables for Linux and Windows (mritools)](https://github.com/korbinian90/CompileMRI.jl/releases)
**Download link for mritools: https://github.com/korbinian90/CompileMRI.jl/releases**  
*For a compiled MacOS version, see [MacOS](https://github.com/korbinian90/ROMEO#macos), but the suggested way is Option 4*

### Option 2: Run in [Neurodesk](https://neurodesk.github.io/) (every OS)
Neurodesk is an analysis environment for reproducible neuroimaging running in a docker container.
It comes with a range of useful tools preinstalled, including ROMEO.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Phase (and optionally Magnitude) images in NIfTI fileformat.  
For multi-echo/multi-timepoint data, 4D-NIfTI files are used with echoes/timepoints in the 4th dimension.   
Individual 3D files can be merged into 4D files using [fslmerge](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Fslutils).  
If 5D-NIfTI datasets with channels in the 5th dimension are given, coil combination can be performed as first step. 

### Run ROMEO
ROMEO is a command line application. The binary is in the folder `mritools/bin`

Example usage for single-echo data:  
`$ romeo ph.nii -m mag.ii -k nomask -o outputdir`

Example for multiple time points with identical echo time (fMRI):  
`$ romeo ph.nii -m mag.ii -k nomask -t epi -o outputdir`

Example usage for a 3-echo scan with TE = [3,6,9] ms:  
`$ romeo ph.nii -m mag.ii -k nomask -t [3,6,9] -o outputdir`

Note that echo times are required for unwrapping multi-echo data.

## Different Use Cases
### Multi-Echo
If multi-echo data is available, supplying ROMEO with multi-echo information should improve the unwrapping accuracy. The same is true for magnitude information.

### Phase Offsets
If the multi-echo data contains **large phase offsets** (phase at echo time zero), default template unwrapping might fail. Setting the `individual-unwrapping` flag is a solution, as it performs spatial unwrapping for each echo instead. The computed B0 map is not corrected for remaining phase offsets.

For proper handling, the phase offsest can be removed using `MCPC-3D-S` with the option `phase-offset-correction`. This works for monopolar and bipolar data, already combined or uncombined channels. However, this requires "linear phase evolution". If the phase is already "corrupted" by other coil combination algorithms, it might not be possible to estimate and remove the phase offsets.

### Repeated Measurements (EPI)
4D data with an equal echo time for all volumes should be unwrapped as 4D for best accuracy and temporal stability. The echo times can be set to `-t epi`.

optional arguments:
  -p, --phase PHASE     The phase image that should be unwrapped
  -m, --magnitude MAGNITUDE
                        The magnitude image (better unwrapping if
                        specified)
  -o, --output OUTPUT   The output path or filename (default:
                        "unwrapped.nii")
  -t, --echo-times ECHO-TIMES [ECHO-TIMES...]
                        The echo times required for temporal
                        unwrapping specified in array or range syntax
                        (eg. "[1.5,3.0]" or "3.5:3.5:14"). For
                        identical echo times, "-t epi" can be used
                        with the possibility to specify the echo time
                        as e.g. "-t epi 5.3" (for B0 calculation).
  -k, --mask MASK [MASK...]
                        nomask | qualitymask <threshold> | robustmask
                        | <mask_file>. <threshold> for qualitymask in
                        [0;1] (default: ["robustmask"])
  -u, --mask-unwrapped  Apply the mask on the unwrapped result. If
                        mask is "nomask", sets it to "robustmask".
  -e, --unwrap-echoes UNWRAP-ECHOES [UNWRAP-ECHOES...]
                        Load only the specified echoes from disk
                        (default: [":"])
  -w, --weights WEIGHTS
                        romeo | romeo2 | romeo3 | romeo4 | romeo6 |
                        bestpath | <4d-weights-file> | <flags>.
                        <flags> are up to 6 bits to activate
                        individual weights (eg. "1010"). The weights
                        are (1)phasecoherence
                        (2)phasegradientcoherence (3)phaselinearity
                        (4)magcoherence (5)magweight (6)magweight2
                        (default: "romeo")
  -B, --compute-B0      Calculate combined B0 map in [Hz]. Phase
                        offset correction might be necessary if not
                        coil-combined with MCPC3Ds/ASPIRE.
  --phase-offset-correction, --coil-combination [PHASE-OFFSET-CORRECTION]
                        on | off | bipolar. Applies the MCPC3Ds method
                        to perform phase offset determination and
                        removal (for multi-echo). This option also
                        allows 5D input, where the 5th dimension is
                        channels. Coil combination will be performed.
                        "bipolar" removes eddy current artefacts
                        (requires >= 3 echoes). (default: "off",
                        without arg: "on")
  --write-phase-offsets
                        Saves the estimated phase offsets to the
                        output folder
  -i, --individual-unwrapping
                        Unwraps the echoes individually (not
                        temporal). This might be necessary if there is
                        large movement (timeseries) or
                        phase-offset-correction is not applicable.
  --template TEMPLATE   Template echo that is spatially unwrapped and
                        used for temporal unwrapping (type: Int64,
                        default: 2)
  -N, --no-mmap         Deactivate memory mapping. Memory mapping
                        might cause problems on network storage
  --no-rescale          Deactivate rescaling of input images. By
                        default the input phase is rescaled to the
                        range [-π;π]. This option allows inputting
                        already unwrapped phase images without
                        manually wrapping them first.
  --threshold THRESHOLD
                        <maximum number of wraps>. Threshold the
                        unwrapped phase to the maximum number of wraps
                        and sets exceeding values to 0 (type: Float64,
                        default: Inf)
  -v, --verbose         verbose output messages
  -g, --correct-global  Phase is corrected to remove global n2π phase
                        offset. The median of phase values (inside
                        mask if given) is used to calculate the
                        correction term
  -q, --write-quality   Writes out the ROMEO quality map as a 3D image
                        with one value per voxel
  -Q, --write-quality-all
                        Writes out an individual quality map for each
                        of the ROMEO weights.
  -s, --max-seeds MAX-SEEDS
                        EXPERIMENTAL! Sets the maximum number of seeds
                        for unwrapping. Higher values allow more
                        seperated regions. (type: Int64, default: 1)
  --merge-regions       EXPERIMENTAL! Spatially merges neighboring
                        regions after unwrapping.
  --correct-regions     EXPERIMENTAL! Performed after merging. Brings
                        the median of each region closest to 0 (mod
                        2π).
  --wrap-addition WRAP-ADDITION
                        [0;π] EXPERIMENTAL! Usually the true phase
                        difference of neighboring voxels cannot exceed
                        π to be able to unwrap them. This setting
                        increases the limit and uses 'linear
                        unwrapping' of 3 voxels in a line. Neighbors
                        can have (π + wrap-addition) phase difference.
                        (type: Float64, default: 0.0)
  --temporal-uncertain-unwrapping
                        EXPERIMENTAL! Uses spatial unwrapping on
                        voxels that have high uncertainty values after
                        temporal unwrapping.

To run romeo executables on MacOS, multiple files have to be flagged as save to execute. Additionally, the executable might only run on specific OS versions. You can try the [newest](https://github.com/korbinian90/CompileMRI.jl/releases) MacOS executable, [v3.2.2](https://github.com/korbinian90/ROMEO/releases/tag/v3.2.2) and [v3.1](https://github.com/korbinian90/ROMEO/releases/tag/v3.1). This problem is still unsolved and no clear way how to improve the compatibility
